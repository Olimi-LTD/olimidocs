## Create Contacts

To start adding contacts to call you first need to create a contact list, then add contacts to this list.
<Tip>
You can also connect the Olimi API to your CRM to dynamically add contacts to your contacts list, if your campaign is connected to this list and you have an active campaign it will call each new contact when they are added.
</Tip>

### Add Contact Individually
After you've created your list you can then start adding your contacts one by one. The only required filed is the phone number, however adding more fields to your contact can help the AI during a call. Especially the gender if the AI is talking in a gender specific language.
### Upload Contacts
To add multiple contacts all at once, first you need to download the template and update all your contact information to that list. Then you will need to upload your sheet to be added to your contact list.
## Connect your PBX
To connect your PBX make sure you follow these [instructions](installation) to install and run the script on the same machine as you Asterisks. If you need further assistant you can book a [free introductory call](https://calendar.app.google/aWmgaGtPSh4Q8PF98) with our technical team.
## Create Extensions
After you have successfully connected your PBX make sure you have add your Extensions. We recommend to create new extensions on your PBX. Make sure that your active extensions have the capacity to make external calls if they are all used at the same time while active.
