## What You Will Need

- **Asterisk 16.6+** installed on your Linux device or a supporting GUI.
- **Node Package Manager (NPM)** to install the necessary package on the same Linux server as your Asterisk.

## Setting up your PBX

#### Open the `ari.conf` File in Asterisk

Locate and open the `ari.conf` file in your Asterisk configuration directory. This file is typically found in `/etc/asterisk/`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/asterisk/ari.conf
```

#### Configure ARI
Add the following configuration to your `ari.conf` file. This includes setting up the ARI (Asterisk REST Interface) and configuring the Stasis application.

```ini ari.conf
[general]
enabled = yes
pretty = yes

[<ari-username>]
type = user
read_only = no
password = <ari-password>

[olimi-app]
type = apps
allowed_origins = 127.0.0.1
```
<Note>
Replace `<ari-password>` and `<ari-username>` with your desired username and password.
</Note>

## Configuring Your Server and NAT

### Open Port 3000 on Your Router
Ensure that port 3000 is open on your router to allow external connections.

### Disable NAT and Firewalls for Port 3000
Disable any NAT (Network Address Translation) and firewalls for port 3000 using the following commands:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT
```
<Warning> 
Disabling firewalls can expose your system to potential security risks. Ensure you understand the implications before proceeding.
</Warning>
### Install the Node Package
In a new terminal on the same Linux server as your PBX (Private Branch Exchange) server, install the Olimi Ltd package using NPM. Replace the placeholders `<account-email>`, `<ari-username>`, and `<ari-password>` with your actual details.

```bash
sudo npx olimi-ltd -u <account-email> -a <ari-username> -p <ari-password>
```
#### Enter Your Olimi.ai Account Password
You will be prompted to enter your Olimi.ai account password during the installation process.

### Verify the Connection
Refresh your PBX to ensure that you are successfully connected.


```bash
sudo systemctl restart asterisk
```
<Tip>
After restarting Asterisk, check the logs to verify that the ARI connection has been established successfully.
</Tip>

By following these steps, you will have successfully installed and configured the Olimi Ltd package on your Asterisk system. For further details and troubleshooting, refer to the official documentation or support channels.
